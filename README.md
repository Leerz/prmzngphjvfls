<p>B. Downloading games and file types</p>
 <button onclick="toggleContent('guideB')">Guide B - Downloading Game and Game filetypes</button>
  <div id="guideB" style="display: none;">
    <p>Nintendo Switch BASE game files, update files, DLC files come in various formats: NSP, XCI, and NSZ. They can all be installed in the same way.</p>
    <p>You can find these files on websites like nxbrew, ns2w, nswgame, and more. For faster searching, type the game name followed by the format you want on Google.</p>
    <p>Please exercise caution, as these websites may contain ads. Downloading games online requires basic to intermediate computer skills.</p>
    <p>If you need guidance on how to navigate and use these websites, you can watch these sample videos:</p>
    <p>Part 1: NSW Game - <a href="https://youtu.be/xyh01mcQVIU">Video Link</a></p>
    <p>Part 2: Ziperto - <a href="https://youtu.be/ZA2kes_I_ZI">Video Link</a></p>
    <p>For instructions on installing NSP, NSZ, and XCI files, please refer to guides in section C for DBI RESPONDER.</p>

<p>C. Installation of downloaded games</p>
  <button onclick="toggleContent('guideC')">Guide C - Game installation, game updates, dlc</button>
  <div id="guideC" style="display: none;">
    <p>Our recommended method to install games is using the DBI RESPONDER METHOD. Follow this video guide: <a href="https://youtu.be/SEvtKeoIqS8">Link to Video Guide</a>.</p>
    <p>It is easy to use, does not need drivers, supports the majority of operating systems, and has plenty of features for users of basic to advanced experience.</p>
    <p>For other methods like goldleaf, tinwoo, awoo, and tinfoil, you'll need a PC companion app to install games, requiring external applications and drivers to be installed properly.</p>
    <p>If you need to install Switch USB drivers, refer to this guide: <a href="https://www.homebrewgeneral.net/2019/05/install-nsps-over-usb.html">Switch USB Drivers Guide</a>. Focus on the Zadig usage section for specific instructions.</p>

When it comes to cheats, themes, save data manipulation, and other homebrew, we prioritize keeping your Switch close to its default state for stability. This approach prevents errors and is catered to the majority of users, ranging from casual players to newcomers who just want to play games without complications.<br />
<br />
However, if you&#39;re interested in extras like cheats and themes, we recommend exploring different options. These paths require hands-on work.<br />
<br />
You can find helpful resources for your Switch homebrew and apps journey on this website: [Switch Homebrew and Apps Guide](<a href="https://rentry.co/HomebrewAndMisc?fbclid=IwAR094fvDeWGaftYOPA6itufEIzt2ElGO0kkQJaYOc3g9ymIjlJJxt4QS-j0" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">https://rentry.co/HomebrewAndMisc</a>).<br />
<br />
Please be cautious when adding extra software, as mistakes can lead to problems like a softbrick or boot-up issues.</p>

 <button onclick="toggleContent('guideF')">Guide F - Switch Care Guide: Ensuring Your Nintendo Switch's Well-Being</button>
  <div id="guideF" style="display: none;">
    <p><br />
The Nintendo Switch, a sophisticated piece of tech, requires careful handling just like any electronic device. Keep it protected from moisture, water spills, and dust.<br />
<br />
If you&#39;re thinking about making modifications or changes to your Switch, it&#39;s essential to weigh the pros and cons. One critical aspect to be cautious about is your internet usage.<br />
<br />
PreMAZINGPH&#39;s JV setup prioritizes safety, with features like hosts file blocking and exosphere configuration to prevent bans. This generally ensures safe connections in both LEGIT mode and JV mode, provided your JV files are kept up to date.<br />
<br />
Nintendo periodically releases software updates, and for JV switches, updating online requires careful consideration:<br />
<br />
- Are the current JV files (hekate and atmosphere files) compatible with the latest software version?<br />
<br />
<strong>*IMPORTANT:*</strong><br />
Always update your Switch firmware via Daybreak. Never update via the internet.<br />
<br />
PreMAZINGPH strongly recommends researching information online before attempting any updates or operations. Remember, safety begins with you.</p>

<br />
<strong>*Crucial Reminders for the Future:*</strong><br />
- PREMAZINGPH will provide update files upon request when Nintendo releases software updates.<br />
- <strong>*JV Files:*</strong> These encompass hekate, atmosphere, sigpatch, and homebrew apps (HATS Pack) - essential for your jailbroken Switch. We tailor this PACK for ease of use and safety.<br />
- <strong>*Firmware:*</strong> Refers to your Switch&#39;s system or software version, located in settings (e.g., Switch FW 16.1.0).<br />
- <strong>*JV Mode:*</strong> For playing jailbreak games, while the album displays homebrew apps.<br />
- <strong>*Legit Mode:*</strong> Permits online access, eShop use, and online multiplayer.<br />
- <strong>*JV Mode SysNAND:*</strong> A blend of Legit mode with jailbreak apps. <strong>*Avoid connecting online; it carries a high risk of a ban.*</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>*Crucial Reminders for Future Updates:*</strong><br />
- Regardless of your mode (Legit or JV), always update manually via Daybreak. <strong>*Avoid updating system firmware via the internet.*</strong><br />
- Emphasize the differences between game updates (safe in Legit mode) and system firmware updates. They are not the same.<br />
- In jailbreak mode, game updates/DLCs are manually updated via DBI in NSP format (similar to game installation).<br />
- <strong>*Avoid updating system firmware (system version) in JV mode or Legit mode via the internet.*</strong> Always conduct system updates manually.<br />
<br />
These reminders are intended to keep your Nintendo Switch experience smooth and secure in the future.</p>

<div id="guideJ" style="display: none;">

generating /dumping installed games, / creating an installer file from installed games<br />

normally this was a difficult procedure before. but with dbi, this can be done, but it&#39;s not perfect, switch files are decrypted to indistinguishable files inside the Sdcard. dbi becomes a handy tool for what we want to do.<br />

this is the vague instructions on how to do it.<br />
<br />
let&#39;s call the switch you want to copy TO as switch 1 or SOURCE<br />
<br />
<br />
1 Open dbi mtp responder on SWITCH 1<br />
<br />
2. open the &quot;installed games&quot; partition<br />
<br />
3. this view will show a list of files /folders based on the installed games on switch 1<br />
<br />
4. copy the FILE and Folder related to the title you want to create a copy of to a folder on your computer<br />
<br />
(some games will be 1 nsp file, or a combination of file and folder)<br />
<br />
5. after these files are generated to your computer, you can then install these files on any other jailbreak switch.</p>
